# O-WPScan

**O-WPScan** is a professional open-source tool for scanning WordPress websites against a comprehensive list of security vulnerabilities. It is developed using Python and provides an easy-to-use Command Line Interface (CLI).

## Features

- **Comprehensive Vulnerability Scanning:** The tool scans the target WordPress site against a wide range of security vulnerabilities categorized by severity (High, Medium, Low).
- **Detailed Report:** Outputs results in a formatted text file (e.g., `example.com_scan_report.txt`) containing the vulnerability name, scan status, severity, a brief description, and security advice for remediation or prevention of each vulnerability.
- **Easy to Use:** Simple command-line interface for running scans.
- **Extensible:** The code structure is organized and flexible to allow for the addition of more scanning modules in the future.

## Requirements

The tool requires the following Python libraries:

- `pyfiglet`
- `requests`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OmarHany-sudo/O-WPScan.git
   cd O-WPScan
   ```

2. Install the requirements:
