# O-WPScan

**O-WPScan** is a professional open-source tool for scanning WordPress websites against a comprehensive list of security vulnerabilities. It is developed using Python and provides an easy-to-use Command Line Interface (CLI).

## Features

- **Comprehensive Vulnerability Scanning:** The tool scans the target WordPress site against a wide range of security vulnerabilities categorized by severity (High, Medium, Low).
- **Detailed Report:** Outputs results in a formatted text file (e.g., `example.com_scan_report.txt`) containing the vulnerability name, scan status, severity, a brief description, and security advice for remediation or prevention of each vulnerability.
- **Enhanced Reporting:** Includes a summary of vulnerabilities by severity, uses clear symbols (‚ùå for discovered, ‚úÖ for non-existent), and adds scan metadata (website link, date/time, tool version) and a signature.
- **Multiple Export Formats:** Reports can be saved as plain text (.txt), Markdown (.md), HTML (.html), or PDF (.pdf).
- **Easy to Use:** Simple command-line interface for running scans.
- **Extensible:** The code structure is organized and flexible to allow for the addition of more scanning modules in the future.

## Requirements

The tool requires the following Python libraries:

- `pyfiglet`
- `requests`
- `markdown`
- `weasyprint`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OmarHany-sudo/O-WPScan.git
   cd O-WPScan
   ```

2. Install the requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install markdown weasyprint
   ```

## Usage

To run the tool, use the following command:

```bash
python3 owpscan.py <target_url> <export_format>
```

- `<target_url>`: The URL of the WordPress site to scan (e.g., `https://example.com`).
- `<export_format>`: The desired report format (e.g., `txt`, `md`, `html`, `pdf`).

Example:
```bash
python3 owpscan.py https://example.com pdf
```

To display help information:
```bash
python3 owpscan.py --help
```

After the scan is complete, a report file (e.g., `example.com_scan_report.pdf`) will be generated in the same directory containing the scan results.
